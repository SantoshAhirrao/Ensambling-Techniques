    "If, for case X(i), a small change in the prediction causes a large drop in error, then the next target outcome is a high value. Predictions from the new model that are close to its targets will reduce the error.\n",

    "If, for case X(j), a small change in the prediction causes no change in error, then the next target outcome is zero because changing this prediction does not decrease the error.\n",

    "## E. Build XGBOOST Classifier\n",
    "XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) is an advanced implementation of gradient boosting algorithm.\n",
    "#### The XGBoost Advantage\n",
    "-  Regularization:\n",
    "    -  Standard GBM implementation has no regularization like XGBoost, therefore it also helps to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "    -  In fact, XGBoost is also known as â€˜regularized boostingâ€˜ technique.\n",
    "-  Parallel Processing:\n",
    "    -  XGBoost implements parallel processing and is blazingly faster as compared to GBM.\n",
    "    -  Boosting is sequential process that each tree can be built only after the previous one, and it  can be parallelized with making a tree using all cores. Refer. http://zhanpengfang.github.io/418home.html\n",
    "    \n",
    "    -  XGBoost also supports implementation on Hadoop.\n",
    "-  High Flexibility\n",
    "    -  XGBoost allow users to define custom optimization objectives and evaluation criteria.\n",
    "    -  This adds a whole new dimension to the model and there is no limit to what we can do.\n",
    "-  Handling Missing Values\n",
    "    -  XGBoost has an in-built routine to handle missing values.\n",
    "    -  User is required to supply a different value than other observations and pass that as a parameter. XGBoost tries different things as it encounters a missing value on each node and learns which path to take for missing values in future.\n",
    "-  Tree Pruning:\n",
    "    -  A GBM would stop splitting a node when it encounters a negative loss in the split. Thus it is more of a greedy algorithm.\n",
    "    -  XGBoost on the other hand make splits upto the max_depth specified and then start pruning the tree backwards and remove splits beyond which there is no positive gain.\n",
    "    -  Another advantage is that sometimes a split of negative loss say -2 may be followed by a split of positive loss +10. GBM would stop as it encounters -2. But XGBoost will go deeper and it will see a combined effect of +8 of the split and keep both.\n",
    "-  Built-in Cross-Validation\n",
    "    -  XGBoost allows user to run a cross-validation at each iteration of the boosting process and thus it is easy to get the exact optimum number of boosting iterations in a single run.\n",
    "    -  This is unlike GBM where we have to run a grid-search and only a limited values can be tested.\n",
    "-  Continue on Existing Model\n",
    "    -  User can start training an XGBoost model from its last iteration of previous run. This can be of significant advantage in certain specific applications.\n",
    "    -  GBM implementation of sklearn also has this feature so they are even on this point."

    "\n",
    "-  **learning rate/eta:** governs how quickly the model fits the residual error using additional base learners. If it is a smaller learning rate, it will need more boosting rounds, hence more time, to achieve the same reduction in residual error as one with larger learning rate. Typically, it lies between 0.01 â€“ 0.3\n",
    "-  **max_depth:** max depth per tree. This controls how deep our tree can grow. The Larger the depth, more complex the model will be and higher chances of overfitting. Larger data sets require deep trees to learn the rules from data. Default = 6.\n",
    "-  **subsample:** % samples used per tree. This is the fraction of the total training set that can be used in any boosting round. Low value may lead to underfitting issues. A very high value can cause over-fitting problems.\n",
    "-  **colsample_bytree:** % features used per tree. This is the fraction of the number of columns that we can use in any boosting round. A smaller value is an additional regularization and a larger value may be cause overfitting issues.\n",
    "-  **n_estimators:** number of estimators (base learners). This is the number of boosting rounds.\n",
    "<br><br>The three hyperparameters below are regularization hyperparameters.\n",
    "-  **gamma:** min loss reduction to create new tree split. default = 0 means no regularization.\n",

    "It combines multiple classifiers to increase the accuracy of classifiers. AdaBoost is an iterative ensemble method. AdaBoost classifier builds a strong classifier by combining multiple poorly performing classifiers so that you will get high accuracy strong classifier. The basic concept behind Adaboost is to set the weights of classifiers and training the data sample in each iteration such that it ensures the accurate predictions of unusual observations. Any machine learning algorithm can be used as base classifier if it accepts weights on the training set. Adaboost should meet two conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The classifier should be trained interactively on various weighed training examples.\n",
    "In each iteration, it tries to provide an excellent fit for these examples by minimizing training error.\n",
    "How does the AdaBoost algorithm work?\n",
    "\n",
    "It works in the following steps:\n",
    "1. Initially, Adaboost selects a training subset randomly.\n",
    "2. It iteratively trains the AdaBoost machine learning model by selecting the training set based on the accurate prediction of the last training.\n",
    "3. It assigns the higher weight to wrong classified observations so that in the next iteration these observations will get the high probability for classification.\n",
    "4. Also, It assigns the weight to the trained classifier in each iteration according to the accuracy of the classifier. The more accurate classifier will get high weight.\n",
    "5. This process iterate until the complete training data fits without any error or until reached to the specified maximum number of estimators.\n",
    "6. To classify, perform a \"vote\" across all of the learning algorithms you built.\n",
